<p>Below is the real-time version of the avatar at the top of this site. It is a rudimentary implementation of the classic tunnel effect running on software (no hardware acceleration, so prepare for high processor load). The inspiration came from <a href="https://www.skrolli.fi/numerot/2014-3/">an article on the tunnel effect</a> in a finnish computer culture magazine <i>Skrolli</i>.</p>
