# About an about page

Information technology in general is interesting, and it feels like there is always something more to learn. In particular, telecommunication and information security are some long-time interests. Seeing what is really happening in a network widens the perspective and teaches that stuff is not always what it seems.

Similarly, playing with data from various sources, transforming and visualizing it, and automating the process is interesting and rewarding. Computer graphics, namely demoscene, is also one of the reasons I am on the field. Seeing [*Chaos Theory*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfk5Mqy3gpA) blew my mind that such a small computer program could produce stunning visuals. Also, I think some Lorem Ipsum describes me quite well. Praesent vitae tempor odio. Sed volutpat malesuada enim. Moreover, proper software engineering is something I should learn more, both DevOps and the traditional processes for comparison.

Trying out different kinds of technologies is both entertaining and educating. On the other hand, sometimes it may leave a feeling that I do not have deep knowledge, that I am just dabbling in technology.
